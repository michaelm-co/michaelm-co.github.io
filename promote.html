            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
              Fulfilling the promise to be a <i>white glove</i> service means not only solving problems in your core product, but also solving problems end-to-end for your clients. At Next Thought we discovered that our potential clients were not just wanting to have meaningful learning experiences online, but also desired to collaborate to promote them. As our partnerships with our clients grew we were no longer promoting single courses, but instead full online master programs. This increase in investment from both our team and our clients led us to the strategic choice to help our clients promote their programs. Including this service as a product offering gave us a unique sales advantage over our competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the core product team would be working on these pages, system thinking was viewed as mission critical on this project. We needed a template that was flexible and scalable enough to require minimal changes between programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the fall of last year, I was tasked to research, design, and refine a process to execute successful master page launches.
            </p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <h4>Meet with Key Stakeholders</h4>
            <p>
              I met with Lead Front-End Developer Jonathan Grimes, Head of User Experience Aaron Eskam and Chief Product Officer Rob Reynolds to discuss the objectives of the project. From a design perspective we wanted to create a website with clean and open typography that looked great across devices. From a development perspective, Jonathan expressed concerns that the development team wanted to devote energy upfront to make a strong, flexible template that only needed minimal changes between programs and across clients.

            <p class="text-white">
              I started the project by doing a competitive audit to get a sense of what other universities were communicating on their landing pages. My first interest was in promotion for other master programs and my second comparison was online degrees. Researching postgraduate programs offered insight into the information needs perspective students had including: pricing, duration, and time commitment. Online degrees helped provide possible concerns people had about taking a program online. One common concern was related to the stigma associated with online programs and whether or not the word “online” would be appear on their diploma.

            </p>
            <p class="text-white">
              Another benefit, was analyzing what content people were including on their promotional sites as a way to forecast how a template might scale beyond this singular client. While a lot of content ideas were applicable, there were opportunities to rethink the representation of some modules. As a company that has relationships with many clients, we also knew that in order for these templates to work we would need to be realistic about what content clients would reliably be able to produce.

          <h4>Visually Engaging, Let Information Breathe</h4>
          <p>
            A key part of our design aimed to inspire potential student with rich imagery and open up the content to let it breathe. Using various treatments of space, containers, and typography gave the content shape and distinction. Establishing a hierarchy, made the information more scannable and enjoyable to consume.

          <h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
          <p>
            Armed with ideas about our goals and examples of content our competitors were using, I started the process of creating rough content wireframes. The big concern with creating the template is was how it would responds to flexible inputs: some programs exercised brevity, while others use the maximum character count. Trying to make the template attractive across devices with variable content length was challenging, but worth the initial effort to avoid constant manual adjustments. From the beginning, I had been stress-testing modules against different screens sizes.

          <h4>One Course Outline to Rule them All</h4>
          <p>
          The trickiest component in creating a master template, was the course outline. The competitive audit and discussions with our clients revealed that some programs were organic, offering courses only once or pivoting the program’s area of focus often. Other programs were more predictable and structured, a similar class being offered consistently every year. One way we decided to show course structures, was not by the generic season and year, but instead by thematic groupings. This alternative approach gave enhanced meaning and new inspiration to the sets of courses.
          </p>
          <p>
			Another issue at play, was the reliability of the individual departments to provide, or display, all of the content in the template. After dozens of possible structures, I finally arrived at a solution that accommodated most of the scenarios.

              In the past we have had to pull back our "slick" factor, because it turns off a lot administrators in the ed-tech market. Partly, because many perceive those products as entirely focused on the visuals and not the outcomes. Also this happens, because many education facilities are facing budget cuts and "slickness" has been associated with premium pricing. The political and budget argument becomes “how can we afford this platform and slash funding across other areas of campuses. In this case, we got the green light from our stakeholders to push our presence forward. Using Principle, I started prototyping interactions.

          <h3>3 Launched, 3 in the Queue</h3>
          <h4>Refining Internal Processes</h4>
          <p>
            The first launch was a huge lesson for me. Previously, I had been thinking of the design in two silos: the design of each solution and the production of solutions. In the first phase of production, we do everything from research to mock-up, even picking the right shade of color for the text. In the second phase we are often working with developers to build out our solutions and make adjustments when necessary. But, when designing systems for people to use, there is a third phase that happens simultaneously with the other two: content management. There was an assumption that I made, that the content for the site would be neatly preserved in one location as it passed from the client to project managers and to the developers. What actually happened, were dozens of snippets of information scattered across Gmail, Google Hangouts, Wrike, and Excel spanning multiple months sprinkled with revisions.

          </p>
          <h4>Better Pipes</h4>
          <p>
            Recognizing the importance of content organization as a design exercise, I began to rethink how information should flow. By creating a folder for the overall masters programs and a Google Doc template with sections, labels, and placeholders in the company Google Drive, clients and project managers now had a place to collaborate and keep information in one location. When everything was finished, this document could serve as a one stop for our developers to pull content. This created better transparency for all the teams about what content was still missing, and tracking changes allowed us to keep up with changes made after build started. The new flow significantly cut build time landing pages.
