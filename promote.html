            <h3>Problem.</h3>
            <p>
              Fulfilling the promise to be a <i>white glove</i> service means not only solving problems in your core product, but also solving problems end-to-end for your clients. At Next Thought we discovered that our potential clients were not just struggling to have meaningful learning experiences online, but also doing a less than stellar job to promote them. As our partnerships with our clients grew we were no long promoting single course, but instead full online master programs. This increase in investment from both our team and client side led us to the strategic choice to help our clients promote their programs as a unique sells advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the core product team would be working on these pages, system thinking was viewed as mission critical on this project. We needed a template that was flexible and scalable enough to require minimal changes between programs. In the fall of last year, I was tasked to research, design, and refine a process to execute successful master page launches.

          <h4>Meet with key stakeholders.</h4>
          <p>
            I met with Lead Front-End Developer Jonathan Grimes, Head of User Experience Aaron Eskam and Chief Product Officer Rob Reynolds to discuss our client’s current designs and vision for how we could do better. From a design perspective it was not hard to do better. Their pages were set in small type, imageless, and not mobile friendly. From a development perspective,  Jonathan expressed concerns that they wanted to devote energy upfront to make a strong, flexible template that only needed minimal changes between programs and across clients.

              I started the project by doing a competitive audit to get a sense of what universities were communicating on their landing pages. There were two main segments I was interested in. The first was master programs and the second was online degrees. Postgraduate programs offered insight into information needs that students in that position were looking for and online degrees gave insights into concerns people had with taking a program online.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white">
              The other benefit was trying to find a consensus about what content people were actually including as a way to forecast if the template we were making would scale to client beyond OU. While a lot of content ideas did transfer over there were opportunities to rethink the representation of some modules. As a company that has had relationships with many clients we also knew that in order for these templates to work there were realities that we had to face what content clients would reliably be able to produce.

          <h4>Responsive Web Design.</h4>
          <p>
            Armed with ideas about our goals and content our competitors were using I started the process of creating rough content wireframes. The big concern with the template is how it responds to flexible inputs: some programs would write at length about everything, some exercised brevity. Trying to make the layouts be attractive across devices with variable content was challenging, but worth the initial effort to avoid constant manual adjustments. From the beginning I had been stress testing modules against different screens sizes knowing that it needed to be responsive.

          <h4>Visual Engage, Let Information Breathe.</h4>
          <p>
            Many landing pages our clients currently had for their masters pages were very dense and not very scannable. A key part of our design refresh aimed to inspire potential student with rich imagery and open up the content to let it breathe. Using various treatments of space, containers, and typography gave shape and distinction to content. Effectively establishing hierarchy made the information more scannable and enjoyable to consume.

          <h3>Outcome.</h3>
          <p>
            The ability for students to select text and highlight it or start rich conversation shipped out to all of our clients’ production environments last fall. We are still waiting to gather analytics to assess how successful the solution has been with our users.
