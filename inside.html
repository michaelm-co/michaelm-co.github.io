Escape Velocity is the work and investment required for established companies to break patterns in their business to find new levels of growth and sustainability.</p>

We had organized it in such a way that scale (in the way that agencies traditionally do this—more offices, more admin, more offerings) was in conflict with the values of the company. If we wanted to be successful over the long term, we would need to fundamentally retool how the company worked to resolve this tension.</p>
