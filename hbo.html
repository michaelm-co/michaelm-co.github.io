            <h3>The world’s best content.</h3>
            <p>HBO has become nearly synonymous with great entertainment. The premium cable network has won acclaim and cult followings for original series ranging from Sex and the City to Game of Thrones. HBO is also a company of firsts: the first cable channel to specialize in films; the first channel to be delivered via satellite; the first movie channel to expand into original programming. So it’s no surprise that in 2010, HBO became one of the first entertainment companies to deliver its content to subscribers anywhere, anytime, on nearly any device or platform with HBO GO®. To leverage the unique opportunities provided by digital channels and connect with subscribers in new ways, HBO turned to Huge.</p>
            <p>If Teehan+Lax was to be successful going forward, we would need to find, what Geoffrey Moore calls, Escape Velocity. Escape Velocity is the work and investment required for established companies to break patterns in their business to find new levels of growth and sustainability.</p>

        <section class="da4-da8 t3-t9 m2-m7">
          <p>The project began with apps for iOS and Android, and would continue for a multi-year engagement spanning eight launches. In our research, we learned that HBO fans all wanted one thing: more access to the programs they love. We wanted to build on HBO’s strength as a content creator by providing subscribers with a premium viewing experience for all devices. Ultimately, we determined to limit the number of steps involved in getting users right into the content, while also providing ways to explore more great content.</p>
          <h3>Get out of the way.</h3>
          <p>It was clear early on that a version of HBO GO for tablet and mobile had to help users accomplish two key tasks:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Play the Video you Want.</li>
            <li>Discover New Original Content from HBO</li>
            <li>Save and Buy Media</li>
            <li>Connect with Arists and Share their Work</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The first goal was imperative. The second emerged when we learned how extensive HBO’s library of original content was. The team quickly became excited about the ways in which mobile applications could aid the discovery new content, opening subscribers up to the best possible advertisement for HBO — more of HBO’s own content.</p>
          <h3>Iterate, iterate, iterate.</h3>
        </section>

        <img class="da3-da9 t2-t10 m-all" src="img/hbo-3.png" alt=""/>

        <section class="da4-da8 t3-t9 m2-m7">
          <p>Working as a single team, we wasted no time getting started. Huge’s product design group presented work several times a day, developing and iterating multiple prototypes until we had a product that lived up to HBO’s formidable reputation. Our approach to the work integrated HBO with Huge’s strategy, design and UX teams who made a point of sketching every idea that came out of brainstorming — whether for a single page or the entire platform. Sketches were immediately turned into prototypes, which were tested with actual users and then changed accordingly. To nail the opening page of the iPad application, we designed 28 different wireframes and built out 4 separate versions.</p>
          <h3>Beyond the carousel.</h3>
          <p>"It has a drift to it… this is a little cognitive hack that is trying to get you to do something or look at something in a way that’s not the way you’d naturally engage with it." —Cliff Kuang, Senior Editor, Design, Wired.</p>
          <p>This agile process helped us solve a big problem: how to successfully promote the most popular and latest content while also aiding the discovery of new content from HBO’s catalog.</p>
          <h4>Beginning Phase Two</h4>
          <p>The solution came in the form of a gently drifting mosaic grid that let HBO feature more content upfront. This was a radical departure from the standard carousel model, which prioritizes a single hero image at a time, and it became a defining element of the HBO GO tablet experience. From the mosaic, viewers can begin watching full-length programming with one click, the shortest possible distance from discovery to watching.</p>

          <h3>First launch done, seven to go.</h3>
          <p>From the beginning, HBO wanted its subscribers to be able to access GO wherever they were, from Smart TVs to video game consoles. But replicating the success of the iOS and Android apps was not as easy as cutting and pasting: every platform is unique, with its own set of features and constraints.</p>
          <p>The Samsung Smart TV interface, for example, has no back button, requiring the design of panels that users go deeper into the content, to the right of the screen, and then exit by going back left.</p>
          <p>Many platforms, like Roku, employ specific design templates that must be adhered to. To ensure a seamless HBO GO experience, we had to hack these templates. For Roku, we found a way to create dividers between categories in a long list — between letters in an alphabetical list, for example.</p>
          <p>Other platforms, like the Xbox 360, used UI styles that were so new at the time we had to invent our own guidelines to move forward. Microsoft’s new Metro style for the Xbox was still in development while we were designing for it.</p>
        </section>

        <img class="da3-da9 t2-t10 m-all" src="img/hbo-5.png" alt=""/>

        <section class="da4-da8 t3-t9 m2-m7">
          <p>One thing that remained consistent throughout was the approach to design. Working with HBO’s technology team, we used the same rapid prototyping methodology to extensively test every new interface or interaction component before committing to the final design. This adaptability proved essential as user testing challenged our initial assumptions time and again. Moving from the mobile app to the TV apps like Samsung and Roku, for example, meant evolving the design for a close-up experience to one appropriate for the actual use case.</p>
          <p>User needs always showed us the way. With the xBox 360, we had to consider different and divergent users in a shared living room experience. The mom who needs to be able to pick up the controls and find her favorite show and the teenage gamer who knows his way around the system. We had to make the experience exciting for the gamer but also accessible for the mom.</p>
