            <h3>Problem.</h3>
            <p>
              In a college course there is often a tremendous amount of information presented to you, some is critical and some is not. A key component of successfully navigating a course is being able to differentiate between the two, and aggregate the pieces that matter most. This phenomenon is not any different in the online learning space.            </p>
            <p>
              For some time we have had the functionality to be able to visually annotate the information we presented to students. Highlighting, bookmarking, and favoriting information are common tools in the analogue space that we have echoed in the digital space. Echoing is not enough. These methods of annotation only serve to visually indicate important information.

            <p>
              Visually indication important information is valuable, but on it’s own it falls short of allowing students to see the items they have collected throughout the course together on one screen. The evaluation of any tools is measured by the degree it enhances human capability. In October of 2015, I was tasked with producing a solution to his very problem.
            </p>
            <h3>Process.</h3>
            <h4>Meet with key stakeholders.</h4>
            <p>
              I began with discussing the project with two of our Front-End Engineers Andrew Ligon and Pacifique Mahoro and Head of User Experience Aaron Eskam. Everyone involved recognized there was a short window for action between post-semester maintenance and our huge end of the year push to build authoring tools (link) for the platform. This was often the case that in an agile environment based on scaling the core functionality of the product you needed high impact, with minimal development time.
            </p>
            <h4>Deciding where in belongs in the scaffolding.</h4>
            <p>
              I began by defining the problem that we were trying to solve and organizing possible relationships between a curated content feed and information architecture of our platform. The actual action that would add something to a notebook or activity stream could happen anywhere those objects exist. The notebook or activity stream however were four main possibilities where it could fit in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Global Navigation</strong>
              The main problem with this approach is it would position notebooks outside of courses. This solution was not well suited for two main reasons. The first involved the navigation flow from a particular lesson or reading inside a course to a note in a notebook. It involved too much effort. The second was more theoretical. By placing notebooks outside of courses you are essential severing their semiotic relationship. This type of structure I think would be more suited to notebook creation and notebook management not necessarily connected to courses. In the short term this was not the intent.

            <p>
              <strong>Library View</strong>
              Our library view currently contained mixed object types. Your library included communities you were a part of, courses you were enrolled in, and books you downloaded. So it was forseeable that notebooks could also belong here. Although, in practice we decided it also didn’t quite fit the interaction flow. This solution would result in popping into a course out to library view and then into a notebook and back and forth again. This pop-in, pop-out flow hindered what you were trying to do.

            <p>
              <strong>Tab inside a Course</strong>
              In the end this is the direction we decided on. What was elegant about this solution was how it worked in practice. The lesson tab allows you to navigate to a particular lesson and open a reading, watch a video, or start a lesson and if you navigated away remember what spot you were on. This worked elegantly with notebook because you could essentially slide back and forth between content you are currently consuming with content you’ve collected throughout the course.

            <p>
              <strong>Tab under User Profile</strong>
              We also felt that the same sort of representation of the stream and how you filter through it could happen here as well. However this stream would be a cross section of multiple courses having a different goal than notebook. This section could be thought of more as user activity than curated study material.

            <h4>Modes of Sorting</h4>
            <p>
              The various methods people use to interact with objects across the platform was already in production including: bookmarks, highlights, likes, discussions. The representation of the objects themselves needed a little refining. But mostly the project focus on the presentation of this view and how users could interact with the stream of content. Most of our platform had keylines that supported two columns: one a wider column for main content, and a skinnier column for navigation and supplemental information. I knew we were going to use the larger column for the cards and leverage the skinnier column for a powerful panel to help users sort their collections. The following panels show functionality and interaction explorations.

              <h4>Behavior Matrix.</h4>
              <p>
                Once we settled on a layout and a set of functional requirements we got our development team to sign off on, I began creating a behavior matrix in Google Sheets to document the functional results of certain combinations and the UI controls and make sure the system I created would not break. I marked the areas where that I foresaw potential technical challenges. For instance, at one point in time were not consistent in capturing the date an object was bookmarked, highlighted or liked. This has ramifications on if UI controls for date ranges or sorting by date would render anything meaningful. Thankfully after sharing it with the development team and discussing routes forward they were confident they could support the functionality in the specification.

            <h4>Fine Tuning the UI.</h4>
            <p>
              Before handing it off and moving on there were still some areas that needed be tightened up. I went through several round of explorations on these issues.

              <li>Empty States</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <strong>Visual Treatment</strong>
              Visually treating the panel was an interesting challenge. At first, there was a temptation to find a way to subdue it or push it back in space due to the amount of real estate it occupied in the view. So I explored different visual directions with that in mind. I tried translucent black and white. Both had an interesting effect when interacting with the blurred course image that sits underneath all of the panels across all the views of a course. I tried it without a container for exploration. While this last exploration was interesting there were concerns about color contrast on different backgrounds even with the darkening we apply to the backgrounds. But in the end all of these explorations felt more visually active than just treating it with a white container. Lastly I went through and gave more proportional whitespace throughout the filter panel.

            <p>
              <strong>UI Copy</strong>
              Choosing the right copy for the controls would make or break the success of it. We did a quick competitive audit of how sorting and filtering toggles were communicated to their audiences and explored our own afterward. Aaron, Sammy and I had internal discussions about whether the time range should be indicated with words past, last, previous. In the end I decided that past was the least ambiguous, using the current day as the point of reference. User testing showed that “recent activity” in combination with the date range was confusing. More on this later.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Native Controls</strong>
              Our team had been moving away from custom controls for a while now toward more native controls mostly to get all the accessibility feature, but also provide controls that people are used to seeing. So we designed a custom select button that triggers the native drop down and gave generous spacing to the checkboxes to make them more integrated in the design. From a behavior perspective though we made the whole row active as opposed to just the checkbox.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Empty States</strong>
              I also wanted to consider how this view looks like before users interact with anything but also if they manipulate the filter panel in such a ways that the parameters yield no results. How does the system communicate to you that you how you can add items to your notebook and how does it inform you that nothing matches your parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having three designers do everything from promotional work to UX/UI flows meant being selective with what we poured time into. One of the more unfortunate instances of this is empty states. While we do try to craft intentional and helpful messaging, they did not really delight or inspire use.

            <h4>Handing off to developers.</h4>
            <p>
              Before I got our team on <a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> we were red lining and creating behavior specifications as a documentation artifact for developers to refer to.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <h4>User Testing UI Copy</h4>
            <p>
              User testing the panel revealed that one of the controls was confusing people. In the sort by field we were messaging “recent activity” to sort the view by the object that was interacted with last. The intention with this control was to elevate objects which had a recent spark of activity. The problem was that people were not interpreting it as anyone interacting with it. They were interpreting is a recent activity they performed and when they tried to reconcile how that control related to date range they were even more confused.

            <h4>Currently in QA, set to Launch this Summer</h4>
            <p>
              The solution is currently in quality assurance testing and should ship to users at the start of the summer semester. The plan is to add support of this functionality to the iPad and mobile web application shortly after.

            <h4>Looking forward.</h4>
            <p>
              One idea that I explored that I hope can be added in the future is the idea of creating notes not attached to content with a compose view anchored to the bottom of the screen to offer a picture-in-picture experiences. This type of experience would be powerful, allowing student to navigate all over their course and keep all their content in one place.
